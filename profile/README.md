# Project Manges

## About us
- We are hardworking teenagers who live in Türkiye. We love linux and everything about it.

## Why do we make an operating system
- We know theres thousands of os's based on debian. We want to be different. We want to make an operating system thats built by Turks and not bullshit. We want EVERYONE to be able to use this operating system.
